Hi, I'm Ítalo, a 26-year-old front-end developer who lives in São Paulo/Brazil, and this is my blog, in which I intend to address general issues concerning the universe of web development and related fields.

You may find useful tutorials or inconclusive digressions around here, about specific topics such as JavaScript and CSS or broad ones such as Free Software.

Feel free to comment or reach me by e-mail anytime.
