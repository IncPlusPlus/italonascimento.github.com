Just as anything else inside digital environments, interfaces are composed of symbols and abstractions. Any UI peace is a model of some concept or thing which already has meaning to users.

To illustrate that, try to interact with this button:

(include button that doesn't respond to cursor interaction)

It that even a button? Well, maybe it is. You just can't make sure whether it's performing any action or not.

Now try this one:

(button with :hover and :active effects)

It doesn't even need to perform any action to feel like a button, does it? I just makes sense for us by behaving like we know a button should behave.
